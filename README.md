# Babel exercise
The goal of this exercise is to be able to install node.js and get a very basic HTTP server up and running.

## Get started
The first thing to do is to install Node, and NPM, which comes with it.  We will also need git, to get hold of the exercise materials.

### Installing Node and NPM

#### On MacOS and Windows
Download and run the installer from https://nodejs.org/en/
(alternatively, if you are on MacOS and have homebrew installed, you can type 'brew install node' on the command line)

#### On Linux
Probably the easiest way is to install node from your package manager.  Follow the instructions for your distribution here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

### Installing Git
You also need to make sure you have git installed.  Follow the instructions on the Git project's website:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

## Exercise
We are going to make a very simple HTTP server that only works on your local computer, and responds "Hello World" to every request.  A good introductory exercise; perhaps also useful in certain [very specific circumstances](http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/)

### 1.  Clone this repository
On the command line, navigate to a suitable directory where you want to work, and use the 'Clone or download' option on the github repository page to clone the repository

### 2.  Fix the index script
Have a look at index.js.  Try to use it by running 'node index.js' on the commad line.

You will notice that the script is completely broken; your first task is to fix it so that it works.

Read the comments in the code!  They will give you further clues and instructions.
